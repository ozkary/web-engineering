# Web Engineering Fundaments with React - Introduction

## What is ReactJS

ReactJS, or React, is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (UI). At its core, the UI uses HTML markup for the elements like tables, divs, input fields. To add behavior, we use JavaScript , or TypeScript, to bind and respond to UI events like buttons clients and input entry. This framework lets us create reusable UI components that manage their own state and update automatically when the data is changed by the user. The components are built using HTML elements with a specific behavior, like a login form, data grid, chatbot interface and any other UI composite component that handles a single responsibility.

Some of the key features of React include:

**Focus on components:** React is all about breaking down the UI into independent, reusable pieces called components. Each component can handle its own data and logic, making your code modular and easier to maintain.

**Declarative:** We describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of figuring out how to make it happen. This makes our code more predictable and easier to debug.

**Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight in-memory representation of the UI. This allows it to efficiently update only the parts that have changed, leading to smoother performance.

**Popularity:** React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in the world, with a large and active community. This means there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and build amazing things with it.

**Here are some of the things React can be used for:**

- Building web applications (single-page, server-rendered)
- Creating mobile apps (with React Native)
- Developing desktop applications (with Electron)
- Building user interfaces for other platforms (like wearables and VR)
